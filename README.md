Complete results and scripts associated with the scientific paper written by Atchison et al. A Topic Based Analysis of Scientific Computing Software


We leverage Latent Dirichlet Allocation to analyze R and MATLAB source code from 10,051 R packages and 27,000 open source MATLAB modules in order to provide empirical insight topic space of scientific computing. Our method is able to identify several generic programming concepts and, more importantly, concepts that are highly specific to scientific and high performance computing applications. We are also able to directly compare these topics using document entropy and topic uniformity scoring. This study represents the first of its kind, focused on statistical computing software, and provides a foundation for future work that looks to compare and contrast this rapidly growing codebase with other software domains and repositories.
